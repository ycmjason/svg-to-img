The reason this `jimp.min.js` is compiled and put here is because the browser version of jimp at [v0.2.28](https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp/releases/tag/0.2.28) is broken but the [resizing of v0.2.27 is not perfect](https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp/pull/159).

So I compiled the latest master of jimp which seems to have fixed both.

TODO: Should use next version of jimp if it ever come out.
